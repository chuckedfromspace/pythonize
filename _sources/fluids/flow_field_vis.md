# Flow Field Visualization: PVC

As one of my research focuses, I work extensively with experimental and
analytical methods for visualizing and understanding turbulent (reacting)
flows. On the experimental side, I use techniques such as [particle image velocimetry (PIV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_image_velocimetry)
and laser [shadowgraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowgraph) to visualize (multiphase) flow fields. On the analytical side, I use [principle component analysis (PCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) and some of its variants (such as my own little adaptation [MRPOD](https://github.com/chuckedfromspace/mrpod)) to carry out (multi-scale)
pattern recognition for identifying important dynamical structures in the flow field.

This chapter will focus on how to synthesize typical flow field dynamics. In [Pattern Recognition](../ml/pattern_recognition.md), I will demonstrate how to use tools such as PCA and neural networks to extract flow field patterns.

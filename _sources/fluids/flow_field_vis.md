# Flow Field Visualization

As one of my research focuses, I work extensively with experimental and
analytical methods for visualizing and understanding turbulent (reacting)
flows. On the experimental side, I use techniques such as [particle image velocimetry (PIV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_image_velocimetry)
and laser [shadowgraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowgraph) to visualize (multiphase) flow fields. On the analytical side, I use [principle component analysis (PCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) and some of its variants (such as my own little adaptation [MRPOD](https://github.com/chuckedfromspace/mrpod)) to carry out (multi-scale)
pattern recognition for identifying important dynamical structures in the flow field.

I'll start this chapter by demonstrating how to synthesize typical flow field dynamics, before
going on to show how PCA is commonly used for extracting flow field patterns.
